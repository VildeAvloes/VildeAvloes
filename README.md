I'm currently working on school projects in my spare time learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In my job I'm working with TypeScript and React. I'm like working with a framework such as React, but I also enjoy the process of writing vanilla JS. My favourite thing about writing code is when I sit in a question and I finally sove my problem.
